# RetailCustomerAnalysis
This report is an analysis of the [Online Retail II Dataset found on the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II) in order analyze the current state of the business, how we are retaining our customers and clustering our customers into High-Value, Mid-Value, and Low-Value categories in order to improve marketing efforts. <br>

We will be creating a **classification model** in order to predict in the future if a customer will be High-Value, Mid-Value, or Low-Value. 

The **hypothesis** that we will be testing will be to analyze if certain products are being purchased by certain customer groups. For example, High-Value customers are purchasing certain products that can be then marketed to Mid-Value and Low-Value customers in order to increase the revenue.

**Null Hypothesis**: Product purchased (description) has no an effect on customer groups. 

**Alternate Hypothesis**: Product purchased (description) does have an effect on customer groups. 

**Interest In The Dataset**: <br>
Personally, I am interested retail businesses and in customer behavior. I believe marketing efforts can be improved in many organizations by marketing to the right customers and in order to provide value to them based on their needs. 

**Context On The Data**: <br>
The dataset consists of transactional data with customers in 41 different countries who make purchases from an online retail company based in the United Kingdom (UK) that sells unique all-occasion gifts
